# Char-ttrpg-builder
Create and view tabletop gaming characters in 5e D&D. 
The Python CLI app does technically work, but it was more an afternoon project than anything worth using.
The webpage is far from complete, and even farther from polished. 
Still very much WIP. Installation guide will be up once there's something to install.
